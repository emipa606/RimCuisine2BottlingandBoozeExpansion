  <RC2_Wine.description>Popular among snobbish glitterworlders and medieval nobles alike, wine is made from fermented and aged grapes.  Many varieties exist depending on the type of grape used, additives, and how long the wine is aged, most wine produced on rimworlds is made from whatever types of grapes that can be found and enjoyed by any who can get a hold of it.</RC2_Wine.description>
